            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>In a saucepan, bring water, butter, and salt to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to low and add all-purpose flour. Stir continuously until the mixture forms a
                    ball and pulls away from the sides of the saucepan.</li>
                <li>Remove the saucepan from heat and let it cool for a couple of minutes.</li>
                <li>Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition, until the dough is smooth and shiny.</li>
                <li>Transfer the dough to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip.</li>
                <li>Pipe small mounds of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each puff.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes or until the profiteroles are golden and puffed.</li>
                <li>Remove the profiteroles from the oven and let them cool completely.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream with powdered sugar and vanilla extract until stiff peaks
                    form.</li>
                <li>Cut the profiteroles in half horizontally and fill each with a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
                <li>Drizzle chocolate sauce or melted chocolate over the filled profiteroles.</li>
                <li>Serve the delicious Profiteroles immediately or refrigerate for later enjoyment.</li>
